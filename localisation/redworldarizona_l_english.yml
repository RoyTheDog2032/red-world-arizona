redworldarizona.1.title:0 "The Debate Over The Future Of Arizona"
redworldarizona.1.desc:0 "It's time for the future of our state to finally be chosen. Men and women from every part of the political spectrum have shown up here in the Arizona house of representatives to debate the future of this state turned country. Some of the more notable delegates who have arrived include Craig Columbus who is a centrist republican and JD Hayworth who is a staunch conservative republican, the current leader Harry Mitchell who is representing the liberal party, Krysten Sinema who is representing Arizona's more left leaning politics, and controversially Jason Ready and Tim Foley who are both border control fanatics and near fascistic rightists."

redworldarizona.2.title:0 "The status of Mexican Arizonians"
redworldarizona.2.desc:0 "The elephant in the room of our country for a long time has been Mexican Arizonians. Craig has stated that he wants a secular inclusive accepting society and legal immigration without violent border control. JD on the other hand, stated that he would rather Arizona be much more staunchly conservative but allow legal immigration with more controlling border security. Harry Mitchell has suggested a compromise between Craig and JD, Kyrsten Sinema has spoken in favor of totally open borders and abolishing any kind of border control. Jason Ready and Tim Foley want to seal off Arizona's southern border completely and shoot anyone they see trying to cross it. How will the debate proceed?"

redworldarizona.3.title:0 "The status of the military of Arizona"
redworldarizona.3.desc:0 "The next issue on the military of Arizona. Currently we don't have an army or a large supply of weapons. All the delegates agree on raising a proper army. The question is how. Craig stated he would want a volunteer army open to all Arizonians and encouragement for the unemployed to work at military factories. JD has suggested limited conscription for male Arizonians and forcing the homeless and lower income citizens to work in weapons factories. Harry has suggested a volunteer army while offering homeless people a job at the factories for wages and food. Kyrsten has suggested limited conscription and letting people choose to work at factories or not and use the army for purely defensive purposes. Jason and Tim want full service by requirement for men only and forcing all able bodied women into the factories. Which side do we pick?"

Craig has suggested primarily working with the healthcare companies. JD has suggested working with the retail companies. Harry has suggested both. Kyrsten has suggested seizing it all and collectivizing. Jason and Tim said they would want to go through them personally and kick out any that would disagree with their views."

redworldarizona.6.desc:0 "Toward the end of the debate Jason Ready and Tim Foley quietly snuck out of the room and met up with 10 members of their border patrol group. Shortly after the delegation concluded, the 12 men walked in and sprayed the room down in automatic weapon fire and no one was spared. Jason and Tim's militia has also begun the process of completely seizing the state capitols and cities and beginning mock trials of all those who have been deemed as traitors. It was said there wasn't an inch of the room that wasn't soaked in blood."
